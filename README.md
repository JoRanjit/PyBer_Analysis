# PyBer City Ride Share Analysis
### ---------------------------------------------------------

## Overview of PyBer City analysis project:
### ---------------------------------------------------------
	* This project is designed to analyse the data captured by a ride-sharing app called 'PyBer'
	* Based on the data gathered by the app from Jan 2019 through early May 2019, this project aims to provide 
	  directions to the companys' senior management to make strategic decisions.

### For our analysis - ride share data is grouped together into 3 city types:
		* Urban
		* Suburban
		* Rural
		
####	-- the project provided these informative insights:
		* Urban city rides make the highest fares of all 3
		* But the average fare per ride for rural cities are 41% higher than urban cities, at $34.62 compared to $24.53.
		* And the average fare per driver is also higher by more than 200% for rural cities than urban cities	
			-- Rural city average price by drive is at $55.49 compared to $16.57 for urban city drivers.

### Summary:
### ---------------------------------------------------------
	
####	Based on the analysis the recommendations are:
		* Increase the rides to rural areas which will reduce the higher price, and in turn attract more customers
		* Promote more suburban rides as they are the cost effective and popular of all the 3 city types
		* Introduce more promotional discounts/offers for urban/suburban areas during the 1st few weeks of the year - Jan thru Feb 2nd week
		  as they saw lesser market share than rural cities.
